# Diagnostic: A Java Project for Health Index Processing

This project serves as a lightweight solution for processing health indices received from sensors and assigning appropriate medical units. It exemplifies a clean and modular design, adhering to the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

**Incremental commits reflect the project's evolution under TDD principles.**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**
- **Sensor Integration**: Abstracted handling of sensor health indices.
- **Medical Unit Assignment**: Logic-driven assignment of appropriate medical units.
- **Monitor Display**: Flexibility to format and display results per requirements.

---

## ‚ö° **Key Highlights**
- Built with **TDD methodology**, ensuring robust and reliable code.
- Demonstrates a **proof of concept (POC)** through simplified implementations.
- Designed for easy integration and extension by interoperability squads.

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
### Running the Project
- The `Main` class provides a demonstration of client interactions.
- Note: **POC Implementations** are included for:
    - `SensorService`
    - `MonitorService`
- These mock implementations simulate the behavior of the sensor and monitor components. Full-fledged implementations are expected to be provided by the interoperability team.

## üîß **Core Components**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`SensorService`**
- **Role**: Abstracts sensor interaction for fetching health indices.
- **Ownership**: To be implemented by the interoperability team based on specific sensor requirements.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`InterpreterService`**
- **Role**: Defines the logic for assigning medical units based on health indices.
- **Implementation**:
    - Fully implemented in the class `InterpreterServiceImpl`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **`MonitorService`**
- **Role**: Abstracts the logic for formatting and displaying the assigned medical units.
- **Ownership**: To be implemented by the interoperability team according to display requirements.
